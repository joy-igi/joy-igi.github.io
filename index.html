    <div class="post-content">
      <p> Over the years, romance stories have evolved in Nollywood from recreating romance as seen in Hollywood films, to telling romance stories that are uniquely Nigerian. These new romcoms are a departure from juju-influenced relationships and marriages like in Steve Guskas' Keeping Faith to keep note of. Another romance narrative that Nigerian filmmakers have abandoned is the cliched story where the daughter or son of a rich man falls in love with someone from a modest background and risks everything to keep the relationship.</p>
      <p>The increase in production budget has helped improve the quality of onscreen love with the infusion of fairytale, destination weddings like that of Nonso and Deardre </p>
